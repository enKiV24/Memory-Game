I started my playing with coding when I was about 12, trying to create my own game similar to "Warblade" on the Unity engine. It was going fine but unfortunately I didn't finish the game. I returned to coding in college. I thought it would be easier, but I was wrong. A lot of people in college had graduated from IT schools, or already had a job as a programmer, so I had a harder time because I had to catch up with their skills. This put me off programming. In my second year of studies, I decided that I would learn programming by myself. While learning I realized that writing code gives me a lot of pleasure. I do not have enough skills to be a programmer yet, but if I want to, I learn quickly. While doing the recruitment task, I had a lot of fun and I learned that there is still a lot of work ahead of me.
